# check-code
I have tested each lines of the codes individually on git bash without the comments and the inputs. I imported and used Chicago as my case study to test the codes. But when i run the codes on Vs studio, Iget these argmax errors (Exception has occurred: ValueError attempt to get argmax of an empty sequence) on line 101 Please i need help.
